and ensures proper authorization before performing the check-in operation.

**`Throws`**

UnauthorizedError if the current user lacks authorization to perform the check-in operation.

**`Throws`**

**`Remarks`**

The function performs the following checks and operations:
1. Verifies the existence of the current user, event, and attendee.
2. Checks if the current user is authorized to perform the check-in operation.
3. Checks if the attendee is already registered for the event. If so, updates the check-in status and isCheckedIn.
4. Checks if the attendee is not already checked in for the event then creates a new check-in entry and create new eventAttendee with chechInId and isCheckedIn.
